##
# BluePay Ruby Sample code.
#
# This code sample runs a $3.00 Credit Card Sale transaction
# against a customer using test payment information. If
# approved, a 2nd transaction is run to update the first transaction 
# to $5.75, $2.75 more than the original $3.00.
# If using TEST mode, odd dollar amounts will return
# an approval and even dollar amounts will return a decline.
